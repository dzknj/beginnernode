all of the code here i typed over and over again each time for the most part for each section of the book. i never copied and pasted with an exception for the html to create the forms and the upload buttons and all that because that would have been excruciatingly annoying to do over and over again. I know you said to leave commented code out but i left it in because first of all, this is not an actual program that I will be using or submitting for credit, and I wanted to keep the previous code that was written so that I could easily look back and compare for the sake of learning. I understand that I can go to previous git commits, but i did not make commits until i was finished. I think i have a waaaaaaaaaaaaayyyyy better understanding of what node can do and what it is used for and also how to actually use it. I still have to do my bitmap assignment which i am actually scared of and i think i will fail out of the class because of my incompletion of this assignment, but i will attempt to complete it before i lay my head tonight
